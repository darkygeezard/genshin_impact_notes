 Iâ€™m a low spender, so my farming routine is a bit different. Since ganyu rerun is in a month, I need 4.4K more primogems. Here is my farming plan for reference.
-blessing of the welkin moon
-commissions
-spiral abyss (earned about 15 percent of primo income with this)
-character story quests or hangouts (I finished all the story quests already, and they give 60 primogems for finishing)
-archon quests (already finished)
-World quests (Tatara Tales, Lost in the snow, Serai Stormchaser, ect)
This is quick and efficient for me, I already have 10.1k primogems with this method.
